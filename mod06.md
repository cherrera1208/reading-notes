# Dynamic Web Pages With JavaScript: *basic JavaScript*

# JavaScript Introduction

JavaScript is the most common language used for creating dynamic webpages. JS transforms static, isolated pages into interactive and engaging ones.

Again, an "introduction" must be made from JS to HTMl. This time, the relational link will appear about halfway down the page, around the body, as follow...

`<script src='app.js'></script>`

Notice the JS title page is `app.js`

There is much more nuance and planning that occurs when writing in JS compared to HTML and CSS. If HTML is the bones, and CSS is the clothing, then JS is the brains of the website. Therefore, expect more variables, literally

JS introduces *variables* into the mix, which is a programs way of identifying data by a code word. Just like math variables, letters can mean numbers, but also phrases, and objects. 

`let x = 9;`
`let y = 7;`
`let z = x + y;`
