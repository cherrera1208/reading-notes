1. If I get a JWT and I can decode the payload, how can we call that secure?

    * the token is sent with a secret that both(all) parties need to know to be able to decode the message.

2. If sending a JWT, what must sender and receiver both know? Hint, itâ€™s appended in the signature.

    * the secret

3. Explain how concatenated content and secret can be sent and received securely to a non-technical recruiter.
