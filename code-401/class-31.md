[Context API](https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html)

1. What can React Context provide your app?
    * provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level
2. Why might we use Context?
    * to share data that can be considered "global" for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language
3. Why should we use it sparingly?
    * it makes component reuse more difficult

1. Consume content from (at least) two of the Awesome React Context links. Share your take-away from each:
    1. Takeaway 1:
        * codepen theme example: Simple but super effective showcase of theme changing
    2. Takeaway 2:
        * Diego Haz Free Code Camp: this is almost a relief to learn about. Prior to context, I wouldn't even want to consider the effort required to make a from-scratch theme toggler. So, I'm glad this exists
