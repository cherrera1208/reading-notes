# Module 02 Reading Notes: *Computer Set Up*

## Text Editors

Text editors allow a user to input and edit text. They are simple and can be as barebones as the notepad. VS Code, where this page was written, is a text editor. Compared to the humble notepad, editors like VS Code and Atom are feature rich with optional plugins to enhance and improve the user's experience and accuracy while editing text. Text editors DO NOT ouput the results of the code, which requires a separate program to display the results. For web dev, as one might expect, a web browser would be an acceptable source.

## The Command Line and Terminal

The terminal (in Linux and Mac) and the command line (win) are text based interfaces meant to issue and execute commands to the computer. Unlike a text editor, the text itself isn't edited or saved, instead, the user issues specific commands to the terminal and the terminal responds accordingly. From the terminal, the user can manipulate everything from file creation and deletion, program installion and running, profile and user permisions, and much more.

Navigating the terminal can be confusing and daunting for a beginner because the commands issued must be specific. For example, to navigate a directory, the user would begin their path with 'cd', which means "change directory". In essence, this is the same as using the file explorer (Win) to click on directories and files. Learning will take time and patience, but in the meantime, there are many resources on the web to reference, such as [Ryan's Tutorials](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php)
