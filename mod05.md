# Design Web Pages With CSS: *The basics of using CSS to style webpages*

## CSS

Cascading Style Sheets is a simple but powerful tool that turns basic HTML into intersting and aesthetic webpages that people want to experience. 

Similar to HTML's *index* page, CSS uses a homepage names `style.css`. An important step to remember is to "introduce" the CSS code text to the HTML page. This requires a simple relationship tag to be appended to the HTML file, generally under the title section... 

`<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">`

Much like HTML and the terminal, much of the challenge of CSS is due to the large variety of choices and commands to choose from.
