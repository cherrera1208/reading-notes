# Class-03: Revision and the Cloud _Using terminal and VS Code to edit a GitHub Repository_

## Git

Git is a *distributed version control (DVCS)* which is a *version control* that mirrors multiple repositories onto local systems. This allows multiple users to contribute to collaborative projects simultaneously. Files in Git exist in three states:

- Committed: data is secure in the database
- Modified: data in the file has been changed
- Staged: file is ready to be committed to database

## Using the Terminal to Upload to GitHub

The principle cycle of uploading files to GitHub (a repository hosting website) is known as the A-C-P, *add-commit-push*. The basic process is as follows:

1.`git stautus` this will indicate which files have been modified
2. `git add (file name)` alternatively, use a . to add all
3. `git commit -m""` there must be a comment of why a file was modified, not what or how it was modified.
4. `git push origin main` this will upload the modified repository to GitHub

## Other Basic information

## Terms

- version control: a system that logs version changes of a file, alowing users to revert to earlier versions and track edits.
- local version control: version control that exists on a storage, such as a pc.
- centralized version control: version control stored on a server
- distributed version control (DVCS): allows multiple mirroed repositories, which limits the risk of a single server failure.
- add-commit-push: The Basic
