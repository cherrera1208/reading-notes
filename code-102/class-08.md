# Class-08: Operators and Loops _While, do-while, and For loops_

## While

While loops will occur continuously as long as the condition is valid.

```
while (i < 10) {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
```

## do-while

do-while loops will execute the code once before beginning the loop check 

```
do {
  text += "The number is " + i;
  i++;
}
while (i < 10); 
```
## For loop

Will loop through the code a number of times adjusting a counter of some sort after each iteration until a condition is met. Has three statements. 

```
for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
  text += "The number is " + i + "<br>";
}

```
