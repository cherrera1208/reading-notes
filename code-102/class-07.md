# Class-07: Programming with JavaScript _Going Beyond Variables and Introducing Funtions_

## Control Flow

The order in which statements are executed in a script, generally from left to right and top to bottom. An exception are the structures that change the behavior of the control flow

- conditional structures: if...else

```
if (field==empty) {
    promptUser();
} else {
    submitForm();
}
```

- loop structures: for and while loops

## Function Structures

A function is an encapsulated section of code that can be referenced by other code or itself by interpreting inputs called _arguments_ and returning a value. They are specific instructions or rules that can be used to enhance or complete other parts of code. As a metaphor, beating eggs is a specific instruction that can be applied to different dishes and for various reasons.

- argument:

```

#!/javascript
// When used as a function expression
(function () {});

```
