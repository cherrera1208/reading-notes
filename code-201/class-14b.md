## Summary: 

Diversity and empathy lead to more inclusive group environments promoting better productivity. Googleâ€™s Project Aristole, led by Yale MBA graduate Julia Rozovsky, discovered that the most important factor to a successful team is not necessarily the team with the most accomplished or recognized individuals, but the team that emphasizes psychological safety, i.e. conversational turn-taking and average social sensitivity. So, groups where people feel safe and encouraged to speak will facilitate creative brainstorming and compromise. Basically, the teams that bond as people perform better than the teams that are assembled by accolades and expertise.
