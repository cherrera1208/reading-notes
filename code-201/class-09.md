# Class 09: Forms and JS Events

This is an important topic because forms are how users enter data or information

## HTML Forms

  1. Forms are how the site collect inputs from the user, like username or email.

  2. Accessibility and obvious visual cues

  3.
    - form: submit info
    - label: caption for an item
    - input: accept data
    - textarea: box for free form text from user
    - button: clickable widget

## Learn JS

1. events "signal" the page to react or behave in a certain way due to an input of some kind.

2. name of event and code of handler function

3. Even bubbling is when we "listen" to a larger event (parent) element so we can "hear the smaller pieces that are clicked, and event capturing is the opposite; it is captured on the outer element and propogates to the inner.
