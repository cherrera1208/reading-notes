# Class-01: Introduction to React and Components

## Topic Summary

React is a powerful, widely used library that programmers utilize to make more streamlined and customizable code for web-app UIs. This is achieved through the reusability of _components_.

## Readings

### [Component-Based Architecture](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/software_architecture_design/component_based_architecture.htm)

- Questions:

  1.What is a “component”?

  2.What are the characteristics of a component?

  3.What are the advantages of using component-based architecture?

- Answers:

  1.A component is a modular and reusable set of well-defined functionalities intended to interact with other components.

  2.Encapsulate functionality and behaviors of a software element into a reusable and self-deployable binary unit and is replaceable, non context specific, extensible, encapsulated, and independent. A component can be viewed in three ways: object-oriented, conventional, and process-related.

  - Object-oriented: is a set of one or more cooperating classes.

  - Conventional: is a functional element of a program that processes logic, has an internal data structure to implement that logic, and an interface that enables the component to be invoked.

  - Process-related: Builds from existing componenets maintained in a library.

  3.Component reusability reduces time and cost to develop code, and increases reliability by reusing stable existing components.
