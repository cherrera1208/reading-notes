# Reading Notes Repository

A collection of my notes from the daily reading assignments.

## Growth Mindset

Growth mindset is the state of allowing onselef to become familiar with failure and challenges in order to gain new skills, perspectives, and experiences.

**remember...**

- I _AM NOT_ expected to know everything.
- I _EMBRACE_ challenge and failure.
- I _WILL_ ask for help .
