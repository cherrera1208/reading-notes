# Module 04 Reading Notes: *HTML and other basics of Web Design*

## Wireframing

- A UX<sup>1</sup> concept of creating a model of a proposed website, app, or software idea through physical means, such as a whiteboard, or programs like invision and balsamiq.

<sup>1.</sup> UX = User Experience. Def: the overall experience of a person using a product.

## Mozilla HTML Basics

- HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the most basic language of a website, it's the bare bones framework.

- An element is a line of code in HTML that is the content of a specific section or area of the website. The element is comprised of 3 parts:

1. The opening tag: The beginning name of an element, starts with an angle bracket. e.g. `<p>` represents a paragraph opening tag

2. The closing tag, at the end of the element, uses an a angle bracket but with the forward slash (/). e.g `</p>`

3. The content. The actual content of the element. This can be text, a hyperlink, or a source image, to name a few.

- Anatomy of an HTML Document: There are industry standards to setting up a web page in HTML. The basics are:

1. The homepage should be named index.html

2. Document type should be labeled as `<!DOCTYPE html>`

3. The initial sections should be: HTML>head>meta>title>body>footer

- There are many different tags, attributes, markups, and styles to use in HTML. It would be best to have a reference document handy. [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/HTML_basics) is Mozilla's useful HTML beginner guide.

## Semantics

- Semantics are the meaning of pieces of code. The example used in the Mozilla guide references the header semantic element `<h1>`and compares it to the possibility of "creating" an identical looking header by styling the font and margins accordingly. Even though this would essentially look the same on the webpage, it has no *semantic* value in the code. The source to this example is found [HERE](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Semantics), along with many other references.
