# Class 05: Images, Color, Text

This topic is important because color and text enhances the users enjoyment with the site and could be vital for people who need accessibility features like high contrast. Media makes the site more interactive and alive

## HTML Media

  1. Alt can be used to describe an image. Maybe the image didn't load or the user has a slow/metered connection.

  2. Accessibility can be achieved with larger text, high contrast color palette, or audio.

  3. A figure is a simple description or name of an image. Think of graphs and charts in textbooks with fig.1 as a reference.

  4. GIFs are short, repeated video clips. An SVG is a vector graphic. it uses vector coordinates instead of pixels or simulated pen strokes, and can be practically infinitely scalable. If you want a logo blown up on a banner the size of a building, you use a vector graphic.

  5. I would use a webP because it has better compression than PNG or JPG. Vecotr graphics are cool, but don't work for complex images like a screenshot.

## Using Color in CSS

  1. The background color is everything between the content and the webpage. The foreground is everything between the background and the screen. If it were a Bob Ross painting, the background is the mountain range and horizon, the foreground are the happy little trees.

  2. I would first use a color wheel like the one on Adobe's site, and choose a color pattern that matches the content of the page. If it's a page about their consulting finance business then I probably shouldn't use bright pastel colors. On the other hand, if it's a daycare website, then pastel colors are probably OK. Then I would focus on accessibility, like contrast.

  3. Legibility and context, sans or serif. Also, the content hierarchy. I would make titles bold and more clear, and probably have the body be a serif font like a newspaper.

  4. Font-size changes the font's size, weight changes the thickness of the line stroke, and style adds styles like italics or bold.

  5. letter spacing
