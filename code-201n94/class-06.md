# Class 06: Problem Domain, Objects, and the DOM

This topic is important because objects are the real values used in the world. Primitive data is almost meaningless without reference. objects are that reference.

## JavaScript Objects Basics

  1. An object is a reference with characteristics. An apple is an object that you know as roundish, some hue of red or green, about palm sized, sweet to tart. These are the characteristics "assigned" to an apple; therefore, the apple is an object. If any of those features changed, say the apple grew wings and flew away, then it's no longer an apple. This winged fruit could be newly defined as an apple, but it'll likely be classified as a new object entirely.
  2. If you need to create a bundle of related or structured data. The programmer has more control
  3. Arrays are more of a grouping of like data; an object is more described by data. Arrays are usually numbers and objects tend to be strings. But they are similar.
  4. Thereâ€™s less restriction with brackets
  5. This refers to the object in question. Allows for use of the same method definitions.

## DOM

1. Document Object Model: "the objects that comprise the structure of the content of a document on the web." -MDN Web docs

2. JavaScript accesses the DOM for website elements.
