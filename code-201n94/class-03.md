# Class-03: Lists, Control Flow, and Box Model

Styling a web page with lists, ordered or unordered, can help display information in an easy to read manner or give instructions. The css box model makes a webpage more uniform and organized and pleasing to look at and interact with. And the JS concepts of arrays, operators & expressions, conditionals, and loops are incredibly important in the useability and stability of a website. These are the foundational elements of the logic of a website's behavior.

## Questions

- HTML lists

  1. use unordered lists to group a collection of items that do not have to be ordered numerically.

  2. Bullet styles are changed in the css stylesheet with `list-style-type`.

  3. Use and ordered list to describe groups according to a specific numeric heirarchy or system, such as instructions of a recipe or sections of a document. Unordered list do not rely on numeric values and are simply a collection.

  4. To change the numbers on an ordered list use `start` to begin the list at a designated number, or `reversed` to count backwards.

- CSS Box Model

  1. The margin is the space inside a mailbox, and the padding is the packing peanuts used to protect the item in the package.

  2. the four parts of the box model are content, padding, border, and margin

  - content: what is actually displayed

  - padding: the white area around the content

  - border: the wrapper around the padding

  - margin: the white space around the border enveloping the box

- JS Operators

  1. arrays can store the primitive data types, such as number, string, boolean, and more complex data like objects and other arrays.

  2. It looks like a valid array.

  3. shorthand operators:

     - `x = f()` assignment

     - `x %= f()` remainder

     - `x &&= f()` and

     - `x ^= f()` xor

     - `x ??= f()` nullish

  4. The expression is FALSE because the logical statement affects the entire expression.

  5. if the user fails their password, the website will lock the account.

  6. loop for when the website wants a traffic counter.

## things I want to know more about

I want to learn more about arrays and get more familiar with the operators and conditionals. I have a feeling they are a keystone skill in building programs.
