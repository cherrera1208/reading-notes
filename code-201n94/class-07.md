# Class 07: Object-Oriented Programming, HTML Tables

The importance in this topic lies in the effeciency boost from employing constructors to quickly add or edit objects. Also, tables are a natural way to display simple data.

## Domain Modeling

  1. Domain Modeling:  A model is a simplified abstraction of data, and a domain is a specific realm. So, domain modeling is representing the data of a specific field through simple, abstract ideas. These models will show attributes and behaviors of objects, their methods, or constraints.

## HTML Table Basics

1. Website layouts should not be designed with tables because: 1) it reduces accessibility, 2) causes an overwhelming amount of tags, and 3) makes it challenging to select individual elements.

2. HTML table semantics:

  -`<th></th>` The tables headers; what apears at the top of the column.

  -`<tr></tr>` Table rows are, obviously, the rows of the table

  -`<td></td>` Table data. This is the actual data in each field of the table.

## Introducing Contrustors

1. A constructor is a function that allows the programmer to create, or "construct" many different objects based on initial information values from the constructor.

2. In a constructor, `this` refers to proprties of the objet to be created, not the current function the property in nested in.

## Object Prototypes Using a Constructor

1. prototypes creates a new property to be created for all objects of a constructor instance. This would be like a crew receiving a new uniform item to be added to their current uniform.
