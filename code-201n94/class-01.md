# Class-01: Getting Started: _introduction to WebDev and front-end languages_

This topic will cover the very basic ideas and concepts of front-end languages.

## Getting Started

<!-- Questions:
  
    Compose a short poem describing how HTTP sends data between computers.
    Describe how HTML, CSS, and JS files are “parsed” in the browser.
    How can you find images to add to a Website?
    How do you create a String vs a Number in JavaScript?
    What is a Variable and why are they important in JavaScript?

 -->

 1. Oh, HTTP
    I ask of thee
    To send a request
    of my interest
    from server to me

  2.The browser parses the the files in order from HTML>CSS>JS by reading the elements in the HTML associated with the language type; `<style></style>` for css, and `<script></script>`

  3.Strings are denoted by double quotes `" "`, and numbers do not require any specific characters (other than being numbers).

  4.Variables are what identify new items in the code. For ex. `let x = 5` Here, `x` is the variable assigned by `let` as being a value of `5`.

## Introduction to HTML

<!-- Questions:

    What is an HTML attribute?
    Describe the Anatomy of an HTMl element.
    What is the Difference between <article> and <section> element tags?
    What Elements does a “typical” website include?
    How does metadata influence Search Engine Optimization?
    How is the <meta> HTML tag used when specifying metadata?

 -->

 1.An attribute provides additional info about the contents of an element

 2.angle brackets `<,>`, the element character(s) such as `p` for paragraph or `div` for division, then any attributes like `"lang"` in the `<html>` tag. Then, between the opening and closing brackets, include the content. lastly, finish the element with closing tags `</>`

 3.articles are for specific, individual cases, while sections are for groups. of content.

 4.HEAD, BODY, MAIN, FOOTER

 5.Meta data can be used to specify relevant information for the search engine to find potentially making your site appear higher in the listed results

 6.Meta tag does not use closing brackets. You simply write the tag and element then the attribute content. `<meta charset="UTF-8">`

## MISC

### How to Start to Design a Website

1.The first step to designing a website is planning

2.What are the goals I want my site to accomplish and how to I achieve that purpose?

### Semantics

1.Use the H1 tag because it defines to the browser that it is an important element of the site, and helps with SEO. span is used for different purposes, like inline elements.

2.Semantics tags build the page in an easy to read, flowing style, and divides the page into it's specific elements. Also, the semantics tags are borrowed from traditional markup techniques, like `p` signifying a paragraph, so it's already an established practice.
