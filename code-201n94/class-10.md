# Class 10: Debugging

Debugging is important because it's beneficial to approach problems in a systematic way with the use of specialized tool and programs.

## Trouble shooting JavaScript

<!-- 
    Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.

    List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.

    How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?
 -->

1.Syntax errors are errors in the "grammar" of the code, logic errors are errors in the outcome or performance of the code. Syntax errors will usually not run, logic errors may run but in unexpected ways.

2.The most frustrating errors I've encountered are syntax. One was a missing curly bracket pair after an if statement. I didn't see any lint error and the code ran, but it didn't do what I wanted. Another was the order in which I invoked some functions caused an UND result.

3.Every time I think I figure something out, it breaks in new way. I have to be on high alert for these bugs.

## The JS Debugger

<!-- 
    How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?

    Define what a breakpoint is.
    What is the call stack?
 -->

 1.The important bits are the code and the watch list. The code area is the largest and most obvious, this is where you set breakpoints. The watch area is a list of the breakpoints you have.

 2.Breakpoints are where the user intends to pause the code for troubleshooting. The call stack are the lines of code that were ran.

### Things I Wish I Knew About

I've never used the debugger. I just test things in the code itself. This looks better. So I want to know how to use it.
